<h1>Documentation Resources </h1>

<div>
<h2> 1. Why Document</h2>
<p>
Documentations helps us to understand the code we write.
If working on open source library, users and contributors will have a higher
tendency to use yor library in their projects.
End users of documentation include: You, co-workers, your users
</p>

<h2> 2. Anatomy to READMEs </h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Title
  <li> Description: Capture spirit of project clearly and precisely. Include logo if it has one.
  <li> Include information absolutely necessary for understanding code.
    Includes getting started/installation, usage, contributing, license. Can be short or long, depends on project.
    All the essentials. Don't make assumptions on what the end user knows.
    <ul>
      <li> What <span class="green">steps</span> need to be taken?
      <li> What should the user already have <span class="green">installed</span> or <span class="green">configured<span>?
      <li> What might they have a hard time understanding <span class="green">right away</span>?
    </ul>

</ul>

</p>

<h2> 3. Documentating a Growing Codebase </h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Known bugs
  <li> FAQ
  <li> Table of contents
</ul>
</p>

<h2> 4. Markdown Syntax </h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> double asterisks ** ** makes text bold
  <li> underscores _  _ makes text italicized
  <li> backticks ` ` makes an inline code (not a regular word)
  <li> # before text creates a heading tag (h1 to h6) depending on how many hashes used
    <ul>
      <li> ## = h2
      <li> ### = h3
    </ul>
  <li> ~~ creates a strikethrough
  <li> > quotes text
  <li> Lists can be made with - or * (ul list) or 1.2.3.(ol)
  <li> Links can be made using [] and then (). Example: [GitHub Pages](URL)
  <li> Tasks lists can be created using [ ] and [x]
  <li> Pargraphs - leave blank line between lines of text
  <li> ```  ``` used for codeblock
  <li> README files should be created as .md files (md = markdown)
  <li> Markdown files cannot be opened in browser like HTML, but can preview using Dillinger
  <li> In atom, Markdown preview is baked right into the program (in the 'Packages' menu)
</ul>
</p>
